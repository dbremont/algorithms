# Introduction to Practice Problems in Network Science  

> Network science is a multidisciplinary field that studies complex systems of interconnected elements, from social networks to biological systems and communication infrastructures. At its core, network science provides the tools and theories to analyze and understand the relationships and interactions between entities, offering insights into the structure, dynamics, and function of networks.  

This set of practice problems is designed to give you hands-on experience with the fundamental concepts, algorithms, and applications in network science. Whether you're interested in analyzing social media networks, optimizing transportation systems, or understanding the spread of information or diseases, these problems will provide a solid foundation for exploring real-world networks.  

## Problems

Graph Fundamentals:

- Representing networks as graphs (e.g., adjacency matrices, adjacency lists).  
- Types of graphs: directed, undirected, weighted, bipartite, and multigraphs.  
- Implementing basic graph operations, such as adding/removing nodes and edges.

Network Properties and Metrics:

- **Node Metrics**: Degree centrality, closeness centrality, betweenness centrality, eigenvector centrality.  
- **Edge Metrics**: Edge betweenness, weights, and flow capacities.  
- **Global Metrics**: Diameter, average path length, clustering coefficient, network density.  

Community Detection:

- Identifying communities or clusters using algorithms like modularity maximization, Girvan-Newman, or spectral clustering.  
- Detecting overlapping communities with fuzzy clustering or label propagation.  

Network Dynamics:

- Simulating information or disease spread using diffusion models (e.g., SIR, SIS, or SEIR models).  
- Analyzing cascading failures in networks and designing resilient systems.  
- Modeling opinion dynamics and consensus in social networks.  

Pathfinding and Navigation:

- Solving shortest path problems using algorithms like Dijkstra or A*.  
- Implementing random walks and their applications in ranking or sampling.  

Random Networks and Network Models:

- Understanding and generating random graphs using Erdos-Renyi, Barabasi-Albert, or Watts-Strogatz models.  
- Comparing real-world networks to theoretical models to understand their structure.  

Network Visualization:

- Creating visual representations of networks using tools like Gephi, Cytoscape, or Python libraries (e.g., NetworkX, Matplotlib).  
- Highlighting key nodes, clusters, or connections in visual layouts.  

Network Robustness and Resilience:

- Simulating attacks or failures and analyzing their impact on connectivity.  
- Designing strategies to improve network robustness.  

Multilayer and Temporal Networks:

- Analyzing networks with multiple layers or dynamic connections over time.  
- Exploring interdependencies in complex systems, such as transportation or power grids.  

Applications of Network Science:

- **Social Networks**: Analyze connections, influence, and community structures in social media.  
- **Biological Networks**: Study protein interaction networks or neural networks in the brain.  
- **Technological Networks**: Model communication or power grids for reliability and optimization.  
- **Economic Networks**: Understand trade relationships, financial networks, or market dynamics.
