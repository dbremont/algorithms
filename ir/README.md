# Introduction to Practice Problems in Information Retrieval

Information Retrieval (IR) is the science of finding, organizing, and ranking relevant information from large datasets, often in response to a query. From search engines to recommendation systems, IR is a cornerstone of modern computing, enabling users to access the information they need efficiently and accurately.

This set of practice problems is designed to give you hands-on experience with the foundational concepts, algorithms, and systems in information retrieval. By solving these problems, you'll gain a deeper understanding of how IR systems work and build the skills necessary to tackle challenges in search engines, document ranking, and personalized recommendations.

## Problems

Text Preprocessing:

- Tokenization, stemming, and lemmatization.
- Stopword removal and case normalization.
- Handling noisy or unstructured data.

Indexing:

- Implementing **inverted indexes** for fast retrieval.
- Exploring compressed and distributed indexing methods.
- Dealing with dynamic updates to indexes.

Search and Ranking:

- Implementing ranking algorithms like **TF-IDF** and **BM25**.
- Understanding vector space models and cosine similarity.
- Using language models for document ranking.

Query Processing:

- Designing systems to handle single-word, phrase, and Boolean queries.
- Expanding queries using synonyms or related terms.
- Processing queries in multi-lingual or cross-lingual contexts.

Evaluation of IR Systems:

- Measuring system performance using metrics like **precision**, **recall**, and **F1-score**.
- Implementing ranking-specific metrics such as **NDCG** (Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain) and **MAP** (Mean Average Precision).
- Analyzing trade-offs between precision and recall for different use cases.

Clustering and Classification in IR:

- Using clustering algorithms to group similar documents (e.g., k-means, hierarchical clustering).
- Implementing classification for query intent or document categorization (e.g., Naive Bayes, SVM).

Relevance Feedback and Personalization:

- Implementing feedback mechanisms like Rocchioâ€™s algorithm.
- Building personalized recommendation systems using collaborative and content-based filtering.

Advanced Topics:

- Implementing latent semantic analysis (LSA) or topic modeling (e.g., LDA).
- Exploring neural IR models like BERT for retrieval tasks.
- Handling large-scale IR tasks with distributed systems like Elasticsearch or Solr.

Domain-Specific IR:

- Searching in specialized domains like legal, medical, or academic corpora.
- Implementing faceted search and filtering.

IR at Scale:

- Using distributed frameworks like Hadoop and Spark for large-scale data processing.
- Building scalable IR systems using tools like Elasticsearch, Lucene, or Solr.
