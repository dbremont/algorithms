# Classical Algorithms

> A note that explores the tree of knowledge called algorithm (Algorithm: Problem → Solution Recipe) in the section of the knowledge section called Computation. An algorithm can be thought of as a systematic procedure that defines the rules for state evolution, transforming an initial state into a desired outcome—whether it be a solution, an optimization, or a classification.

> Note: Classical algorithms solve tractable problems—problems that can be fully described and solved using discrete, finite procedures. Modern algorithms extend this toolkit to intractable problems—problems that cannot be fully captured by a discrete, finite description and often require approaches that include a general-architectural representation of the solution and a method for adapting that architecture to approximate or converge toward the solution, often using indirect or iterative techniques.
