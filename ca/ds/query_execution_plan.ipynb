        "A **query execution** plan data structure is a data structure that represents the steps involved in executing a query against a database. It is a tree-like structure that outlines the operations that the database engine needs to perform to satisfy the query.\n",

        "The **data structure** typically includes the following information:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **A root** node that represents the entire query.\n",
        "2. **Child nodes** that represent individual operations, such as table scans, joins, and aggregations.\n",
        "3. **Leaf nodes** that represent the tables or indexes that are accessed during the query.\n",
        "4. **Each node** may contain information about the cost of executing that particular operation, such as the number of disk reads or CPU cycles required.\n",
        "5. **The nodes** may also include any join predicates, filter conditions, and sorting requirements.\n",
        "6. **The data structure** may include annotations or additional information to help the database engine make decisions about how to execute the query.\n",
        "\n",
        "The **query execution** plan data structure is typically generated by the query optimizer, which analyzes the query and the available data sources to generate an execution plan that will produce the results as efficiently as possible. The execution plan is then used by the database engine to actually execute the query, and the nodes of the data structure are traversed in the order specified by the plan to perform the necessary operations.\n",
