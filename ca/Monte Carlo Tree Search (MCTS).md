# Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)

> **Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)** is a heuristic search algorithm for decision-making processes that builds a search tree incrementally and uses random sampling of the decision space to evaluate and optimize actions, balancing exploration and exploitation to find the most promising moves or decisions.
