## Problems

Here’s a list of simple problems that can be effectively solved using Genetic Algorithms (GAs):

| **Problem** | **Description** | **Key GA Features Utilized** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Binary String Optimization** | Find a binary string that maximizes or minimizes a given objective function. | Binary Representation, Mutation |
| **Knapsack Problem** | Determine the most valuable combination of items that can fit within a given weight capacity. | Binary/Real-Valued Representation, Crossover, Mutation |
| **Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)** | Find the shortest possible route that visits a list of cities exactly once and returns to the starting city. | Permutation Representation, Crossover, Mutation |
| **Function Optimization** | Maximize or minimize a mathematical function with real-valued inputs. | Real-Valued Representation, Crossover, Mutation |
| **N-Queens Problem** | Place N queens on an N×N chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other. | Permutation Representation, Crossover, Mutation |
| **String Matching** | Evolve a string to match a target string (e.g., matching a phrase or word). | Binary/String Representation, Crossover, Mutation |
| **Subset Sum Problem** | Find a subset of numbers that add up to a specific value. | Binary Representation, Crossover, Mutation |
| **Symbolic Regression** | Find a mathematical expression that fits a set of data points. | Tree-Based Representation, Genetic Programming |
