# Introduction to Practice Problems in Data Structures  

> Data structures are the building blocks of efficient algorithms and software systems. They provide ways to organize, store, and manage data, enabling quick and efficient access, modification, and retrieval. Whether you're implementing a simple stack or designing a sophisticated graph traversal, a strong understanding of data structures is crucial for solving complex computational problems.  

## Practice Problems

> This set of practice problems is designed to help you master key data structures and their applications. By solving these problems, you'll not only improve your algorithmic thinking but also gain practical experience in optimizing code performance.  

Linear Data Structures:

- **Arrays and Lists**: Basics of indexing, traversing, and manipulating arrays and dynamic lists.  
- **Stacks and Queues**: Implement operations like push, pop, enqueue, and dequeue, and solve related problems (e.g., parentheses matching, sliding window maximum).  
- **Deques**: Solve problems requiring bidirectional access and modification, such as implementing sliding windows efficiently.  

Hashing:

- **Hash Maps and Hash Sets**: Solve problems like frequency counting, two-sum, and anagram detection.  
- **Collision Handling**: Implement open addressing or chaining methods to handle hash collisions.  

Trees:

- **Binary Trees**: Solve traversal problems (inorder, preorder, postorder) and queries like height and depth.  
- **Binary Search Trees**: Implement search, insertion, and deletion operations.  
- **Advanced Trees**: Explore AVL trees, Red-Black trees, and segment trees for specialized use cases.  
- **Trie (Prefix Tree)**: Solve problems like autocomplete and word search efficiently.  

Heaps and Priority Queues:

- **Min-heaps and Max-heaps**: Implement heaps for problems like finding the kth largest element or median in a stream.  
- **Heap-based Algorithms**: Solve problems using heaps, such as Dijkstra’s shortest path or Huffman encoding.  

Graphs:

- **Graph Representations**: Use adjacency lists or matrices for graph storage.  
- **Graph Traversal**: Implement BFS and DFS for connected components, shortest paths, and cycle detection.  
- **Advanced Graph Problems**: Solve problems using algorithms like Dijkstra, Kruskal, and Bellman-Ford.  

Strings and Specialized Structures:

- **Suffix Arrays and Suffix Trees**: Solve pattern matching and longest repeated substring problems.  
- **Rolling Hash**: Implement efficient string search algorithms like Rabin-Karp.  

Advanced Data Structures:

- **Fenwick Trees and Segment Trees**: Solve range queries like range sum or range minimum efficiently.  
- **Disjoint Set Union (Union-Find)**: Solve problems like connected components and Kruskal’s algorithm for minimum spanning trees.  
- **Sparse Tables**: Handle static range queries efficiently with precomputation.  

**Custom Data Structures**:

- Implement specialized data structures like LRU cache, design memory-efficient structures, or build multi-level indexes for databases.
