# Distributed System Algorithms & Practice

> Distributed systems are the backbone of modern computing, powering everything from cloud platforms to large-scale web applications. These systems consist of multiple interconnected nodes that collaborate to achieve a common goal, often while facing challenges like network latency, partial failures, and data consistency. Understanding distributed systems is essential for designing robust, scalable, and fault-tolerant applications.

This set of practice exercises is designed to provide hands-on experience with key concepts and challenges in distributed systems. These exercises will deepen your understanding of how distributed systems work and equip you with the skills to build and analyze such systems effectively.

Practice:

- Explore consistency models (e.g., eventual consistency, linearizability).
- Solve coordination problems like leader election and mutual exclusion.
- Implement distributed locks using algorithms like ZooKeeper or etcd.
- Design systems to handle unreliable communication.
- Build systems that detect and recover from node failures.
- Implement algorithms like Paxos, Raft, and Chandy-Lamport snapshots.
- Simulate failure scenarios to test system resilience.
- Implement retry mechanisms and circuit breakers.
- Implement data replication and analyze trade-offs between latency and consistency.
- Implement load balancing algorithms for even distribution of traffic.
- Explore authentication and authorization mechanisms for distributed systems.
- Explore Delivery Guarantee Semantics
