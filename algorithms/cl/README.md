# Computer Languages Implementation Practice Problems

Computer languages are the foundation of software development, serving as the medium for expressing algorithms and building systems. Implementing a computer language involves creating tools like interpreters, compilers, and virtual machines that enable developers to execute programs written in that language. This process combines theoretical concepts from formal languages and automata with practical skills in systems programming, optimization, and software engineering.

This set of practice problems is designed to provide a hands-on approach to understanding and implementing computer languages. You'll explore key topics such as parsing, syntax analysis, and runtime environments, building the skills necessary to design efficient, expressive, and robust programming languages.

## Problems

Lexical Analysis:

- Design and implement a lexer to tokenize input strings based on a language's grammar.  
- Handle common lexical patterns like identifiers, keywords, literals, and operators.  
- Address error handling in lexical analysis (e.g., invalid tokens).  

Syntax Analysis (Parsing):

- Implement parsers using techniques like:  
  - Recursive descent parsing.  
  - LL(1) and LR(1) parsing.  
  - Parser generators like ANTLR or Yacc.  
- Construct parse trees and abstract syntax trees (ASTs) for given grammars.  

Semantic Analysis:

- Implement type-checking rules for a language.  
- Design and enforce scoping rules (e.g., lexical scoping, dynamic scoping).  
- Handle symbol table management for identifiers and functions.  

Intermediate Representations (IR):

- Generate intermediate representations (e.g., three-address code or abstract syntax trees).  
- Explore control flow graphs (CFGs) and data flow analysis for optimization.  

Code Generation:

- Translate intermediate representations into low-level code (e.g., assembly or bytecode).  
- Implement simple backends for virtual machines or hardware architectures.  

Code Optimization:

- Apply optimization techniques such as constant folding, dead code elimination, and loop unrolling.  
- Explore register allocation and instruction selection for efficiency.  

Interpreters:

- Build interpreters for simple languages.  
- Implement evaluation strategies (e.g., eager vs. lazy evaluation).  
- Extend interpreters with features like closures, garbage collection, and error handling.  

Compilers:

- Create a complete compiler pipeline, from lexical analysis to code generation.  
- Implement optimization passes for performance improvement.  
- Handle advanced features like inline functions or operator overloading.  

Virtual Machines:

- Design and implement a virtual machine for executing bytecode.  
- Implement memory management, including garbage collection algorithms like mark-and-sweep or reference counting.  

Language Features:

- Implement specific features like:  
  - Object-oriented programming concepts (e.g., inheritance, polymorphism).  
  - Functional programming constructs (e.g., lambda expressions, pattern matching).  
  - Type inference systems for dynamically or statically typed languages.
