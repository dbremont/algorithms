# Database Algorithms & Practice

> Databases and system design are foundational areas in computer science and software engineering. They play a critical role in building scalable, efficient, and reliable systems that can handle real-world demands. Mastering these areas requires a deep understanding of algorithms, data modeling, and architectural principles, combined with practical problem-solving skills.

This set of practice problems is designed to help you explore key concepts in database algorithms and system design. By working through these problems, you'll develop the skills needed to design robust systems and optimize database performance. These exercises are ideal for students preparing for interviews, developers enhancing their expertise, or anyone interested in mastering the art of system design and database management.

Algorithms:

- Query Optimization: Techniques to speed up database queries and reduce computational overhead.
- Indexing: Using structures like B-trees, hash indexes, and bitmap indexes to improve data retrieval.
- Transactions and ACID Properties: Ensuring data integrity and consistency in concurrent environments.
- Distributed Databases: Algorithms for partitioning, replication, and distributed consensus (e.g., Paxos, Raft).
- Search and Sorting in Databases: Efficiently handling large-scale datasets.
- HyperLogLog: Estimate cardinalities for large-scale datasets efficiently.
- Leader Election: Implement consensus algorithms like Paxos or Raft for leader election in distributed systems.
- Crash Recovery: Simulate recovery mechanisms, such as WAL (Write-Ahead Logging) or ARIES.
- Lock Management: Design lock-based concurrency control systems (e.g., two-phase locking).
- Isolation Levels: Simulate various isolation levels (e.g., Read Committed, Serializable) and analyze trade-offs.
