# List of algorithms practice problems & algorithms

Operating systems are the backbone of modern computing, managing hardware resources, providing essential services, and enabling software to run efficiently. At their core, operating systems rely on a variety of algorithms to handle tasks like scheduling, memory management, and file system operations. Mastering these algorithms is critical for understanding how operating systems work and for designing efficient systems.

This set of practice problems focuses on the key algorithms that underpin operating systems, providing opportunities to explore their design, implementation, and optimization. By solving these problems, you'll gain a deeper understanding of operating system internals and the ability to apply these concepts in real-world scenarios.

## Problems

- Process Scheduling: Implement and analyze algorithms like First-Come-First-Served (FCFS), Shortest Job Next (SJN), Round-Robin (RR), and Multilevel Queue Scheduling.

- Memory Management: Explore paging and segmentation algorithms, including least recently used (LRU) and first-in-first-out (FIFO) page replacement.

- File Systems: Solve problems related to file allocation methods (contiguous, linked, indexed) and directory management.

- Concurrency: Implement synchronization primitives (mutexes, semaphores) and solve problems like the producer-consumer problem or dining philosophers.

- Deadlock Detection and Avoidance: Analyze deadlock conditions and implement algorithms like the Bankerâ€™s algorithm or resource allocation graphs.

- Disk Scheduling: Simulate algorithms like FCFS, SSTF, SCAN, and C-SCAN for optimizing disk access times.
