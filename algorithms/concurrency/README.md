# Concurrency Algorithms & Practice

> Concurrency is a fundamental concept in computer science that involves executing multiple sequences of instructions simultaneously. It is a powerful tool for improving the performance, scalability, and responsiveness of software systems, especially in today's multi-core and distributed computing environments. However, working with concurrency also presents unique challenges, such as synchronization, resource sharing, and avoiding pitfalls like race conditions and deadlocks.

This set of practice problems is designed to help you deepen your understanding of concurrency and gain hands-on experience with its key concepts. Whether you're a student exploring concurrency for the first time or a developer looking to sharpen your skills, these problems will guide you through the following areas:

- **Threads and Processes**: Understanding how to create and manage threads or processes in a concurrent program.
- **Synchronization Mechanisms**: Using tools like locks, semaphores, and condition variables to coordinate access to shared resources.
- **Deadlock and Livelock**: Identifying, preventing, and resolving issues that can occur when processes or threads are stuck waiting for each other.
- **Parallelism**: Leveraging concurrency to solve problems more efficiently using parallel algorithms.
- **Real-world Scenarios**: Applying concurrency principles to solve practical problems, such as producer-consumer patterns, dining philosophers, and concurrent data structures.

As you work through these problems, you'll encounter various programming models and frameworks commonly used for concurrency, such as thread libraries, task schedulers, and asynchronous programming paradigms.
