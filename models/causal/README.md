# Causal Model: Problems and Practice

> Understanding causality is at the heart of many scientific inquiries and decision-making processes. While correlation helps identify associations, causation seeks to answer the deeper question: **Does one variable cause a change in another?** Causal models provide the framework and tools to explore these relationships systematically, going beyond mere observation to infer, validate, and predict causal effects.  

This set of problems and practices is designed to introduce the principles, methodologies, and applications of causal modeling. It offers a hands-on approach to learning how to design experiments, analyze causal relationships, and interpret results in diverse contexts such as healthcare, economics, social sciences, and machine learning.  

## Practice

Causal Diagrams and Graphical Models:

- Understand and construct DAGs to represent causal relationships.  
- Identify confounders, mediators, and colliders in causal graphs.  
- Apply d-separation to determine conditional independence.  

Counterfactuals and Potential Outcomes:

- Use the potential outcomes framework to model "what if" scenarios.  
- Explore counterfactual reasoning to estimate the effect of interventions.  

Causal Estimation Methods:

- Implement common causal estimation techniques, such as:  
  - Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs).  
  - Instrumental Variables (IV).  
  - Propensity Score Matching (PSM).  
  - Difference-in-Differences (DiD).  
  - Regression Discontinuity (RD).  

Confounding and Bias:

- Identify and adjust for confounding variables.  
- Understand selection bias and strategies to mitigate it.  

Interventions and Policies:

- Model interventions using do-calculus.  
- Predict the impact of interventions in real-world systems.  

Simpsonâ€™s Paradox:

- Understand and resolve instances where trends appear reversed when grouped data is analyzed.  

Applications in Machine Learning:

- Integrate causal models with predictive algorithms.  
- Address causal interpretability in AI systems.  

**Designing Causal Diagrams**:

- Draw a DAG for a scenario (e.g., the relationship between exercise, diet, and health).  
- Identify confounders and determine how they can bias results.  

**Simulating Interventions**:

- Use a dataset to simulate the causal effect of a treatment on an outcome.  
- Compare methods like regression adjustment and propensity score matching.  

**Policy Impact Analysis**:

- Estimate the effect of a policy change (e.g., raising the minimum wage) using causal models.  

**Resolving Confounding**:

- Analyze a dataset with hidden confounders and adjust using appropriate techniques.  

**Exploring Counterfactuals**:

- Answer questions like: "What would have happened if the patient had received a different treatment?"
