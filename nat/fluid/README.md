# Fluid

> Real-time 2D simulation of a Lennard-Jones fluid using Molecular Dynamics and SDL2 in C.

> This project simulates and visualizes the microscopic dynamics of a fluid made of interacting particles. Each particle follows Newton‚Äôs laws and experiences forces based on the Lennard-Jones potential. The simulation shows the emergence of liquid-like behavior from atomic-level rules.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer This is fundamentally a learning project. I started with little to no knowledge of fluid simulation and used large language models (LLMs) to guide my learning process. While this may not qualify as a full-fledged fluid simulation in a professional sense, it represents my effort to understand and experiment with the basic principles of molecular dynamics and fluid behavior at a microscopic level.
